            <h3>Ancient Civilizations</h3>
            <p>Peru’s origins trace back over 5,000 years to the Norte Chico civilization (Caral), one of the oldest known societies in the Americas. Located on the central coast, it featured early urban centers and ceremonial pyramids—marking the beginning of Peru’s rich archaeological legacy.</p>
            <p>Later cultures like the Chavín, Moche, Nazca, and Wari thrived, each contributing remarkable achievements in art, engineering, and religion.</p>

            <h3>The Inca Empire</h3>
            <p>The most powerful of all was the Inca Empire—Tawantinsuyo—with its capital in Cusco. The Inca built a vast network of roads, cities, and agricultural terraces across the Andes. Their architectural mastery led to iconic sites like Machu Picchu, a wonder of engineering and spiritual design.</p>

            <h3> Colonial Influence</h3>
            <p>In the 16th century, the Spanish conquest began a new chapter in Peru’s story. The colonial era brought European language, religion, and architecture—yet Peru’s native cultures endured and adapted.</p>
            <p>The result is a powerful cultural fusion: cathedrals built atop Inca temples, Spanish festivals blended with indigenous rituals.</p>
